# Prediction-Algorithm-
This is a recent code for a scientific project at my college.

In it, I use part of a prepared and cleaned database to train the algorithm and another part to test it. The idea is that it will be able to predict one of the parameters. I am currently trying to lower its average error rate, which is 37%.

I am currently working on it.
